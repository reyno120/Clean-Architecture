The Traditional 3 Layer approach to software architecture consists of the following 3 components:
* Client/Presentation Layer
* Business/Application Layer
* Persistence/Database Layer
This 3 layer approach was the standard for some time and is how many applications are currently written. However, this architecture has it's limitations, especially when it comes to large enterprise applications. As your application grows and becomes more complex it can be harder to maintain and scale up. With this traditional approach your application may become tightly coupled to it's dependencies, making it extremely difficult to swap out later.
